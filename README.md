# Quick Clicker - by Nicolas Falesy

## Press enter as fast as possible in this simple, yet fun game.

### *KNOWN ISSUES*
 - If two or more users get the same score, it doesn't work properly - need to use an array list to fix that

 - If a user presses enter after their turn is finished, it will count towards the next user's score

 - If a user presses enter before their turn starts, it will count it towards their score

- Even if the timer supposedly runs out of time, it will still wait for one more input instead of ending the turn
